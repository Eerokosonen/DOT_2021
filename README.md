# Sleep Tracker - Project work for DOT_2021

## Description
The project work is a tool for an assignment about sleep. The assignment is a subtask in University’s online course (Introductory Course in Public Health). The course is an independently conducted online course that deals with public health science as a discipline and introduces its key topics. The target level of competence is, according to Bloom's taxonomy, at the levels of remembering-understanding-applying (1-3). 

The assignment includes a sleep diary for a week (observing student’s own sleep and its effect on mood and alertness). Based on the student’s observations, the student produces an essay in which he reflects his observations on theoretical knowledge about sleep. 

The sleep tracking tool is designed for course students. The student can keep a sleep diary and write down the most important (guided) aspects for the assignment (eg. perceived quality and quantity of sleep, as well as observations of the effect on the day's alertness and coping). In addition, the student can use the tool to produce a compilation of data that visualizes the amount of sleep from the data. The student can utilize the visualization in the essay. 

The sleep tracking tool collects data about the slept hours, an assessment of the quality of sleep based on the student's own experience, and possibly additional daily notes. The data helps the student to observe the relationship between the amount of sleep and the perceived quality, as well as their own recorded observations of (for example) the day's state of alertness.  

The sleep tracking tool could be logged in with user IDs (the uni e-mail), which could be used to collect data on usage activity.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
