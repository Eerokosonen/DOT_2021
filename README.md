# Sleep Tracker - Project work for DOT_2021

## Description
The project work is a tool for an assignment about sleep. The assignment is a subtask in University’s online course (Introductory Course in Public Health). The course is an independently conducted online course that deals with public health science as a discipline and introduces its key topics. The target level of competence is, according to Bloom's taxonomy, at the levels of remembering-understanding-applying (1-3). 

The assignment includes a sleep diary for a week (observing student’s own sleep and its effect on mood and alertness). Based on the student’s observations, the student produces an essay in which he reflects his observations on theoretical knowledge about sleep. 

The sleep tracking tool is designed for course students. The student can keep a sleep diary and write down the most important (guided) aspects for the assignment (eg. perceived quality and quantity of sleep, as well as observations of the effect on the day's alertness and coping). In addition, the student can use the tool to produce a compilation of data that visualizes the amount of sleep from the data. The student can utilize the visualization in the essay. 

The sleep tracking tool collects data about the slept hours, an assessment of the quality of sleep based on the student's own experience, and possibly additional daily notes. The data helps the student to observe the relationship between the amount of sleep and the perceived quality, as well as their own recorded observations of (for example) the day's state of alertness.  

The sleep tracking tool could be logged in with user IDs (the uni e-mail), which could be used to collect data on usage activity.
